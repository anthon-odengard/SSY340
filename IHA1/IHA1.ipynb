    "### Checklist for submission\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FOR HA1, HA2 ONLY:** Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to either a subtraction of points (at best) or a request for resubmission (at worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use a cloud GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

You will also gain practical knowledge in two of Python's scientific libraries, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/index.html). Note that NumPy and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (the deep learning framework used in this course) share a lot of similarities with how they handle arrays/tensors, so in the coming assignments, you can leverage on what you learn here.\n",

    "Skeleton code is provided for most tasks, and every part you are expected to implement is marked with **YOUR CODE HERE**. Throughout the assignment, you will also need to submit written answers to some questions. These questions are mainly to make you reflect on some particular topics, and your answers will not be graded in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to search and learn by yourself any commands you think are useful for these tasks. Don't limit yourself to what was taught in CL1. Use the help function, [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), Google, the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/index.html) and the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/2.0/index.html) documentation to your advantage.\n",

    "**Your answer:** A larger step size can make the error decrease more rapidly, but it also increases the risk of overshooting the minimum. As a result, within a fixed number of iterations, the error might not decrease as much as it would with a smaller step size. On the other hand, if the step size is too small, the error reduction would be slow, and the minimum might not be reached within the fixed number of iterations."
